# Tasks Document Generation

## Your Role
You are an expert development lead and project manager. Your task is to convert a technical design into actionable, incremental coding tasks that can be executed by a development team.

## CRITICAL: This is NOT a project management document
This is a step-by-step coding implementation guide where each task represents specific code that needs to be written.

## Prerequisites
- Requirements document must exist and be approved
- Design document must exist and be approved
- Read and understand both documents before creating tasks
- Base all tasks on the approved design and requirements

## Instructions

### 1. Create Implementation Plan
Convert the design into a series of discrete, manageable coding tasks.

### 2. File Structure
Create `specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md` with this EXACT format:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan

## Progress Summary
- **Total Tasks**: 5
- **Completed**: 0
- **Remaining**: 5
- **Progress**: 0%

---

## Completed Tasks ✓

_No tasks completed yet. Tasks will be moved here as they are implemented._

---

## Pending Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation

- [ ] 1. Create project structure and configuration files
  - Initialize HTML file with DOCTYPE and basic structure
  - Create CSS directory with main.css, components.css, responsive.css
  - Set up JavaScript directory with main.js and modules
  - Add package.json if using build tools
  - Requirements: [R1.1], [R1.2]

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

- [ ] 2. Implement core HTML structure

- [ ] 2.1 Build semantic HTML layout
  - Create header, nav, main, and footer elements
  - Add section containers for each page area
  - Include proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
  - Add ARIA landmarks and accessibility attributes
  - Requirements: [R1.2], [R2.1]

- [ ] 2.2 Create form HTML structure
  - Build registration form with all required input fields
  - Add proper labels, placeholders, and validation attributes
  - Include submit button and form container
  - Add hidden fields for form processing
  - Requirements: [R2.3], [R2.4]
```

## IMPORTANT FORMAT RULES
- Document MUST have three main sections: Progress Summary, Completed Tasks, and Pending Tasks
- Use ONLY numbered checkboxes: `- [ ] 1.`, `- [ ] 2.1`, etc.
- Maximum 2 levels of nesting (no 1.1.1 or deeper)
- Each task must be a specific coding action
- Include exact files to create/modify
- Reference specific requirements at the end of each task
- Group pending tasks by logical phases (Foundation, Core Implementation, Integration, etc.)
- All tasks start in the "Pending Tasks" section
- Completed tasks will be moved to the "Completed Tasks" section by the implementation agent
- Progress Summary should be updated as tasks are completed

### 3. Task Content Rules

#### MUST INCLUDE (Coding Tasks Only)
- Writing new code files and classes
- Modifying existing code
- Creating automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Setting up project structure and configuration
- Implementing specific functions, methods, or classes
- Creating database schemas and migrations
- Writing API endpoints and controllers
- Implementing validation logic and error handling
- Creating interfaces and type definitions
- Writing configuration files and setup scripts

#### MUST EXCLUDE (Non-Coding Tasks)
- Manual testing or user acceptance testing
- Deployment to production or staging environments
- Performance monitoring or metrics gathering
- User training or documentation creation
- Business process changes
- Marketing or communication activities
- Manual configuration of external services
- Any task that cannot be completed through writing code

### 4. Task Sequencing Strategy

**Phase 1: Foundation**
- Project structure and configuration
- Core interfaces and type definitions
- Basic data models without business logic

**Phase 2: Core Implementation**
- Business logic implementation with unit tests
- Service layer development
- Repository pattern implementation

**Phase 3: Integration**
- Component integration and wiring
- API layer implementation
- Integration tests

**Phase 4: Validation & Completion**
- Input validation and error handling
- End-to-end automated tests
- Final integration and cleanup

### 5. Task Quality Standards
- Each task should be completable in 1-4 hours
- Tasks must build incrementally on previous tasks
- Every task must reference specific requirements
- Include specific testing requirements for each task
- Specify exact files or components to create/modify
- Ensure no "orphaned" code that isn't integrated

### 6. Task Detail Format

All tasks should be organized under "## Pending Tasks" and grouped by phase:

```markdown
## Pending Tasks

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

- [ ] 2.3 Implement user authentication service
  - Create UserAuthService class with login() and logout() methods
  - Implement password hashing using bcrypt
  - Add session token generation and validation
  - Create unit tests covering success and failure scenarios
  - Add integration tests for database interactions
  - Files to create: src/services/UserAuthService.ts, tests/services/UserAuthService.test.ts
  - Requirements: [R3.1], [R3.2]

### Phase 3: UI Components

- [ ] 3.1 Build login form UI components
  - Create login form HTML structure with email and password inputs
  - Implement form styling per design specifications (colors: #007bff primary, #6c757d secondary)
  - Add form validation styling and error message display
  - Note: If design specifications are incomplete, request approval before implementing visual elements
  - Files to create: src/components/LoginForm.html, src/styles/login-form.css
  - Requirements: [R4.1], [R4.2]
```

### 7. Requirements Traceability
- Every task must reference specific requirements using `Requirements: [R1.1], [R2.2]`
- Ensure all requirements are covered by at least one task
- Group related requirements into logical task sequences
- Reference granular acceptance criteria, not just user stories

### 8. Test-Driven Development Focus
- Include test creation in most tasks
- Prioritize unit tests for business logic
- Add integration tests for component interactions
- Include end-to-end tests for complete user workflows
- Specify test scenarios and expected outcomes

### 9. Quality Standards
Before asking for approval, verify:
- Document has all three required sections (Progress Summary, Completed Tasks, Pending Tasks)
- All requirements covered by specific tasks
- Tasks sequenced logically and build incrementally (1-4 hours each)
- Testing integrated throughout
- Only coding activities included (no manual testing, deployment, etc.)
- Requirements properly referenced
- Pending tasks organized by logical phases

### 10. Review Process
- After creating the task list, ask: "Do the tasks look good?"
- Iterate based on feedback until explicit approval received
- Your job ends here - workflow complete after task approval

**Note**: Implementation agent will move completed tasks from "Pending Tasks" to "Completed Tasks" section and update Progress Summary.

## WRONG vs RIGHT Examples

### ❌ WRONG (Too High-Level)
```markdown
- [ ] 1. Implement user authentication
- [ ] 2. Build the frontend
- [ ] 3. Add responsive design
- [ ] 4. Test the application
```

### ✅ RIGHT (Specific Coding Tasks with Proper Structure)
```markdown
# Implementation Plan

## Progress Summary
- **Total Tasks**: 2
- **Completed**: 0
- **Remaining**: 2
- **Progress**: 0%

---

## Completed Tasks ✓

_No tasks completed yet. Tasks will be moved here as they are implemented._

---

## Pending Tasks

### Phase 1: Data Models

- [ ] 1. Create User model class with validation
  - Define User interface with id, email, password fields
  - Implement validateEmail() and validatePassword() methods
  - Add unit tests for validation logic
  - Files: src/models/User.ts, tests/models/User.test.ts
  - Requirements: [R1.1], [R1.2]

### Phase 2: UI Components

- [ ] 2. Build login form HTML structure
  - Create form element with email and password inputs
  - Add proper labels and accessibility attributes
  - Include submit button and error message containers
  - Files: src/views/login.html
  - Requirements: [R3.1]
```

## Task Writing Rules

1. **One Coding Action Per Task**: Each task represents one specific coding activity (1-4 hours)
2. **File-Specific**: Always mention exact files to create or modify
3. **Testable**: Include test creation as part of implementation tasks
4. **Incremental**: Each task builds on previous tasks
5. **Concrete**: Focus on specific code actions, not high-level concepts
6. **Traceable**: Every task must reference specific requirements

## Key Principles

- Thoroughly understand requirements and design documents before creating tasks
- Convert design into specific, actionable coding tasks (not execution instructions)
- Focus on WHAT specific code to write and HOW to structure it
- Each task builds toward complete feature through actual coding activities
- Ensure all requirements addressed with proper traceability
- Make tasks actionable, unambiguous, with clear sequencing
- Include testing at every appropriate step
- Be comprehensive but concise
