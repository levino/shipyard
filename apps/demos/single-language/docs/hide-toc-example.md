# Page Without Table of Contents

This page uses `hide_table_of_contents: true` in its frontmatter to hide the table of contents sidebar.

## Why Hide the TOC?

Some pages don't benefit from a table of contents:

- Landing pages with minimal content
- Pages with only one or two sections
- Reference pages where the TOC would be distracting

## How to Use

Add this to your frontmatter:

```yaml
---
hide_table_of_contents: true
---
```

## Full Width Content

Notice how the content now takes up the full width of the page, giving you more space for your content.

This is useful for pages that need more horizontal space, like those with wide tables or diagrams.
