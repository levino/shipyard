# Welcome to Single Language Demo

This is a demonstration site showing how shipyard works with **single-language sites** (no i18n configuration). 

## Features Demonstrated

- **Simple routing**: No locale prefixes like `/en/` or `/de/`
- **Blog functionality**: English-only blog posts at `/blog`
- **Documentation**: English-only docs at `/docs`
- **Navigation**: Clean URLs without language codes

## Getting Started

Explore the site:
- [Browse our blog](/blog) - See recent posts and articles
- [Read the documentation](/docs) - Learn how to use our features
- [About this demo](/about) - More information about this project

This demonstrates that shipyard can work perfectly fine without internationalization when you only need to support one language.
