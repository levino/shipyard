August at Metro Gardens is a study in abundance! The warm days and consistent care from our dedicated gardeners have created a harvest bounty that's keeping our community well-fed and our surplus table constantly stocked.

## Harvest Highlights This Week

### Tomato Explosion 🍅
Our tomato plants are absolutely loaded! The combination of our early spring soil preparation, consistent watering, and this summer's perfect growing weather has created a tomato paradise.

### Pepper Perfection
From mild sweet bells to fiery habaneros, our pepper harvest is equally impressive. Maria Santos has been leading impromptu "pepper tastings" each Saturday morning.

### Surprise Success: The Cantaloupe Experiment
This year's trial of small-space melons has exceeded all expectations! Jamie Foster's vertical growing experiment produced 6 perfect cantaloupes in just 16 square feet.

## Community Preservation Projects

### Salsa-Making Marathon
Last weekend's community salsa-making session was an incredible success! Using tomatoes, peppers, onions, and cilantro from our gardens, 15 families worked together to produce over 60 jars of fresh salsa.

### Herb Drying Workshop Success
Master herbalist Dorothy Peterson led 20 members through proper herb drying techniques.

## Fall Planning in Full Swing

Our first-ever seed saving workshop drew an enthusiastic crowd of 25 members!
