# Harvest Guidelines

Knowing when and how to harvest your vegetables is crucial for getting the best flavor, nutrition, and continued production from your plants. This guide covers best practices for harvesting at Metro Gardens.

## ⏰ General Harvesting Principles

### Best Times to Harvest:
- **Early morning**: After dew dries but before heat of day (8-10 AM ideal)
- **Late evening**: After temperatures cool (after 6 PM in summer)
- **Avoid midday**: Heat and sun stress reduce quality and shelf life

### Signs of Readiness:
- **Size**: Usually indicated on seed packets or plant tags
- **Color**: Full color development for ripe fruits
- **Texture**: Firm but not hard, gives slightly to pressure
- **Ease of removal**: Ripe produce separates easily from plant

### Harvesting Tools:
- **Clean, sharp knife or scissors**: For cutting stems cleanly
- **Harvest basket or bag**: Breathable containers prevent bruising
- **Gloves**: Protect hands when harvesting thorny or rough plants
- **Spray bottle**: For misting delicate greens

## 🥬 Leafy Greens & Herbs

### Lettuce & Salad Greens
**When to harvest**:
- Baby greens: 3-4 inches tall (21-30 days)
- Mature heads: Full size but before bolting

**How to harvest**:
- **Cut-and-come-again**: Cut outer leaves 1 inch above crown
- **Whole head**: Cut at soil level with sharp knife
- **Harvest early morning** when leaves are crisp and full of moisture

**Storage**: Wash, spin dry, store in refrigerator in breathable bags (up to 1 week)

### Spinach & Arugula
