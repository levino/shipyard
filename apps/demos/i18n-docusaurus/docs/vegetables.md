**Growing tips**:
- Start indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost
- Plant deep - bury 2/3 of stem for strong roots
- Support with stakes or cages (6-8 feet tall)
- Water consistently to prevent blossom end rot
- Remove suckers for indeterminate varieties

**Harvest**: 75-85 days from transplant, when fruit gives slightly to pressure

### Lettuce & Salad Greens 🥗
**Plot requirements**: Can fit many plants in small space
**Varieties recommended**:
- Leaf: 'Black Seeded Simpson', 'Red Sails'

**Growing tips**:
- Wait until soil is warm (60°F+) before planting
- Inoculate seeds with rhizobia bacteria for nitrogen fixation
- Provide 6-8 foot support for pole varieties
- Pick regularly to encourage production

**Harvest**: 50-65 days from seed for snap beans, 90+ days for dry beans

### Carrots 🥕
**Plot requirements**: Need loose, deep soil (12+ inches)
**Varieties recommended**: 'Paris Market' (round), 'Danvers', 'Purple Haze'

**Growing tips**:
- Direct seed only - do not transplant
- Keep soil moist until germination (7-14 days)
- Thin to 2 inches apart when 2 inches tall
- Mulch to prevent green shoulders

**Harvest**: 60-80 days from seed, when shoulders are 1/2 to 3/4 inch diameter

### Peppers 🌶️
**Plot requirements**: Large plot or 1/3 small plot per plant
**Varieties recommended**:
- Sweet: 'California Wonder', 'Sweet Banana'
- Hot: 'Jalapeño', 'Cayenne', 'Fish'

**Growing tips**:
- Start indoors 8-10 weeks before last frost
- Wait for warm soil (65°F+) before transplanting
- Support tall varieties with stakes
- Harvest regularly to encourage production

**Harvest**: 60-90 days from transplant, depending on variety and desired ripeness

### Squash & Zucchini 🥒
**Plot requirements**: Large plot - each plant needs 4-6 sq ft
**Varieties recommended**:
- Summer: 'Eight Ball', 'Costata Romanesco', 'Patty Pan'
- Winter: 'Butternut', 'Acorn', 'Delicata'

**Growing tips**:
- Direct seed after soil warms to 65°F+
- Plant in hills with compost
- Hand-pollinate if bee activity is low
- Harvest summer squash when small and tender

**Harvest**: 50-55 days for summer squash, 90-120 days for winter squash

### Root Vegetables (Beets, Turnips, Radishes) 🍠
**Plot requirements**: Can plant densely, good for succession planting
**Varieties recommended**:
- Beets: 'Detroit Dark Red', 'Chioggia', 'Golden'
- Radishes: 'Cherry Belle', 'Easter Egg', 'Watermelon'
- Turnips: 'Purple Top', 'Hakurei'

**Growing tips**:
- Direct seed for best results
- Thin seedlings to proper spacing
- Harvest radishes quickly before becoming woody
- Both roots and greens are edible

**Harvest**: 25-30 days for radishes, 50-60 days for beets and turnips

## 🌿 Companion Planting

### Beneficial Combinations:
- **Tomatoes + Basil**: Basil repels pests and may improve tomato flavor
- **Carrots + Onions**: Onions repel carrot fly, carrots loosen soil for onions
- **Beans + Corn + Squash**: Traditional "Three Sisters" combination
- **Lettuce + Radishes**: Radishes break soil for lettuce, harvest at different times
- **Peppers + Marigolds**: Marigolds repel aphids and other pests

### Plants to Separate:
- **Tomatoes + Brassicas**: Compete for similar nutrients
- **Onions + Beans**: Onions can inhibit bean growth
- **Carrots + Dill**: Mature dill can stunt carrot growth

## 🐛 Organic Pest Management

### Common Pests & Solutions:

**Aphids**:
- Spray with water, introduce ladybugs, plant trap crops like nasturtiums

**Cabbage worms**:
- Use row covers, hand-pick, spray with BT (Bacillus thuringiensis)

**Squash bugs**:
- Hand-pick eggs from undersides of leaves, use row covers early in season

**Tomato hornworms**:
- Hand-pick (look for dark green caterpillars), encourage parasitic wasps

### Prevention Strategies:
- Rotate crops annually to break pest cycles
- Encourage beneficial insects with diverse plantings
- Keep garden clean - remove diseased plants promptly
- Use physical barriers like row covers when needed

## 💧 Watering Guidelines

### General Principles:
- **Deep, infrequent watering** is better than shallow, frequent watering
- **Water early morning** to reduce evaporation and disease risk
- **Water at soil level** rather than on leaves when possible
- **Mulch heavily** to retain moisture and suppress weeds

### Crop-Specific Needs:
- **High water needs**: Leafy greens, squash, cucumbers
- **Moderate water needs**: Tomatoes, peppers, beans
- **Low water needs**: Herbs (except basil), root vegetables (once established)

### Signs of Water Stress:
- Wilting during heat of day (normal) vs. early morning wilting (needs water)
- Slow growth or stunted development
- Blossom end rot in tomatoes and peppers
- Bitter taste in lettuce and other greens

## 🌾 Soil Health & Fertility

### Soil Testing:
- **Annual soil test** available through extension office
- **pH testing**: Most vegetables prefer 6.0-7.0 pH
- **Nutrient analysis**: Check nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels

### Organic Amendments:
- **Compost**: Apply 2-4 inches annually, provides slow-release nutrients
- **Well-aged manure**: High in nitrogen, apply in fall or early spring
- **Leaf mold**: Excellent soil conditioner, improves structure
- **Bone meal**: Phosphorus source for root development and flowering

### Cover Crops (for unused beds):
- **Crimson clover**: Fixes nitrogen, beautiful flowers attract pollinators
- **Winter rye**: Prevents erosion, adds organic matter when tilled in
- **Buckwheat**: Quick summer cover crop, attracts beneficial insects

## 📝 Record Keeping

### Track Your Success:
- **Planting dates**: Note when you plant each crop
- **Harvest records**: Track yields and harvest dates
- **Weather notes**: Unusual weather events affecting crops
- **Pest/disease issues**: What worked and what didn't
- **Variety performance**: Which varieties performed best in your plot

### Plan for Next Season:
- **Crop rotation**: Don't plant same family in same spot annually
- **Succession planting**: Plan second and third plantings
- **Seed saving**: Mark best performing plants for seed collection
- **Infrastructure needs**: Note areas needing trellises, amendments, etc.

Happy growing! Remember, gardening is a learning process - every season teaches us something new. Don't hesitate to ask fellow gardeners for advice and share your successes! 🌱
