# Welcome to Server Mode Demo

This is a demonstration site showing how shipyard works with **server-side rendering** (SSR). Pages are rendered on-demand per request instead of being pre-generated at build time.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Server-side rendering**: All pages are rendered on each request
- **Blog functionality**: Blog posts at `/blog` with SSR
- **Documentation**: Docs at `/docs` with SSR
- **Dynamic content**: Content can be dynamic and change between requests

## Getting Started

Explore the site:
- [Browse our blog](/blog) - See recent posts and articles
- [Read the documentation](/docs) - Learn how to use our features
- [About this demo](/about) - More information about this project

This demonstrates that shipyard can work with Astro's server mode when you need dynamic, on-demand rendering capabilities.
