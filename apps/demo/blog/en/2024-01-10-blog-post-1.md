What an incredible turnout for our Spring Planting Day! Over 50 community members joined us this past Saturday to prepare our garden beds for the 2024 growing season. The energy was absolutely contagious as neighbors worked side by side, sharing stories, techniques, and plenty of laughter.

## The Day in Numbers

- **52 volunteers** participated
- **48 garden plots** prepared and amended with compost
- **200+ seedlings** transplanted (tomatoes, peppers, and herbs)
- **6 new members** signed up for plots
- **3 workshops** held simultaneously throughout the day

## Highlights from the Day

### Seedling Swap Bonanza
Our annual seedling swap was a huge hit! Members brought extra starts from their home gardens, creating an incredible variety exchange. We saw everything from purple Cherokee tomatoes to lemon basil, and even some exotic pepper varieties courtesy of Rosa Martinez, who's been saving seeds for over 20 years.

### Kid's Garden Magic
The children's area was buzzing with activity. Eight young gardeners, ages 5-12, planted their discovery garden with fast-growing radishes and lettuce. Watching 7-year-old Emma carefully place each radish seed exactly 2 inches apart (she counted!) reminded us why we love involving families in our community garden.

### New Herb Spiral Addition
Thanks to the hard work of our weekend warriors, we completed the expansion of our herb spiral! The new section features Mediterranean herbs that thrive in our sunny location. Special thanks to David Park for donating the beautiful flagstone and to Jennifer Kim for designing the permaculture layout.

## Workshop Success Stories

### "Companion Planting 101" with Rosa Martinez
Rosa shared her grandmother's traditional Mexican companion planting wisdom, demonstrating the three sisters method (corn, beans, and squash) and explaining how marigolds protect tomatoes from harmful pests. Her infectious enthusiasm had everyone taking detailed notes!

### "Composting Basics" with Tom Bradley
Our master composter Tom walked newcomers through our three-bin system, explaining the perfect carbon-to-nitrogen ratio using kitchen scraps and fallen leaves. By the end, we had three new volunteers signed up for our compost management rotation.

### "Seed Starting Workshop" with Sarah Chen
In our mini-greenhouse, participants learned hands-on seed starting techniques, from proper soil depth to creating optimal growing conditions. Everyone went home with trays of lettuce and herb seedlings for their own gardens.

## Community Stories

One of the most heartwarming moments came when longtime member Alice Thompson worked alongside newcomer Jamie Foster to plant Jamie's first garden plot. Alice shared 30 years of gardening wisdom while Jamie brought fresh enthusiasm and modern organic techniques they'd learned online. It was a perfect example of how our garden brings together people from all backgrounds and experience levels.

The lunch potluck was equally amazing, featuring dishes made with ingredients from last year's harvest. Maria's salsa made with our preserved tomatoes was a definite crowd favorite, and we're already planning a "cooking with your harvest" workshop for later this summer.

## Looking Ahead

With our beds prepared and planted, we're excited for what this growing season will bring. Our next community gathering will be the **Monthly Garden Walk** on May 11th at 10 AM, where we'll check on our seedlings' progress and address any early-season questions.

**Upcoming Events:**
- **May 11**: Monthly Garden Walk (10 AM)
- **May 18**: Irrigation System Workshop (2 PM)
- **June 1**: Pest Management Workshop (10 AM)
- **June 15**: Midsummer Potluck & Plot Tours (5 PM)

## Thank You to Our Volunteers

Special recognition goes to our setup crew who arrived at 7 AM to organize tools and materials, and to our cleanup crew who stayed until sunset making sure everything was properly stored. Community gardens thrive because of dedicated volunteers like these!

We're also grateful to **Green Thumb Nursery** for donating potting soil and **City Hardware** for providing tool maintenance supplies.
