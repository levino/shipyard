# Documentation Overview

Welcome to the **Single-Language Shipyard Documentation**! This guide covers everything you need to know about building single-language sites with Shipyard.

## Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

1. **Installation**: Set up your development environment
2. **Configuration**: Configure Shipyard without i18n
3. **Content Creation**: Add pages, blog posts, and documentation
4. **Deployment**: Deploy your site to production

## Key Concepts

### Single-Language Architecture

Unlike multi-language sites that use URLs like `/en/page` or `/de/page`, single-language sites use clean URLs:

- ✅ `/blog` (single-language)
- ❌ `/en/blog` (multi-language)

This makes URLs simpler and more memorable for your users.

### Content Organization

```
