# Single Locale Demo

This is a demonstration application that uses Shipyard without internationalization (i18n) support. It serves as a test case to ensure that the Shipyard components work correctly in single-locale environments.

## Features

- Single locale (English only)
- No i18n configuration
- Tests that verify navigation works without locale prefixes
- Same content structure as the main demo but without locale directories

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```
