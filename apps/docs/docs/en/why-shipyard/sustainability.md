# Sustainability & Production Readiness

Is shipyard ready for production use? Who maintains it? Will it be around in a year? This page answers these questions honestly.

> **Note:** This page reflects the state of the project as of December 2025.

## Is shipyard Production-Ready?

**Yes.** shipyard is already used in several production projects. Most features are working well.

Here's an honest assessment of where things stand:

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Core functionality** | Solid – layouts, navigation, docs, and blog all work reliably |
| **Active development** | Yes – features are prioritized based on real project needs |
| **Semantic versioning** | Yes – breaking changes result in version bumps |
| **Documentation** | Growing – core features are documented |
| **Test coverage** | E2E tests for critical paths |

## Who Maintains shipyard?

shipyard is currently a **one-person project**, maintained by [Levin Keller](https://github.com/levino).

### Is That a Problem?

Not necessarily. Consider:

- **Starlight started the same way** – [Chris Swithinbank](https://github.com/delucis) built it as a solo project before being hired by Astro
- **Many successful tools are small-team efforts** – Quality doesn't require a large team
- **Focused development** – One maintainer means consistent vision and quick decisions

### What About Long-Term Sustainability?

shipyard is used in production for the maintainer's own projects. That means:

- There's real incentive to keep it working
- Features are battle-tested in real use cases
- Bugs get fixed when they affect production

## The Funding Question

Let's be direct about resources:

| Project | Backing |
|---------|---------|
| **Docusaurus** | Meta (Facebook) – significant corporate resources |
| **Starlight** | Astro – Chris Swithinbank is now employed by Astro |
| **shipyard** | Independent – one developer, no corporate backing |

This is a real difference. Docusaurus has dedicated engineers. Starlight has official Astro support. shipyard has one person working on it in their available time.

### Why shipyard Can Still Compete

**AI-augmented development changes the equation.**

shipyard is also an experiment: Can a single developer, augmented by AI tools like Claude, deliver the same value as a well-funded team? So far, the answer seems to be yes.

- shipyard already has features that Starlight lacks
- Development velocity is higher than you'd expect from a solo project
- AI assistance handles much of the implementation grunt work

This isn't about competing with Meta's resources. It's about proving that modern AI tools can level the playing field for independent developers building quality open-source software.

## Contributing

Want to help? Contributions are welcome:

- **Open an issue** – Report bugs or request features on [GitHub](https://github.com/levino/shipyard/issues)
- **Submit a pull request** – Code contributions are appreciated
- **Share feedback** – Tell us what would make shipyard more useful for your projects
- **Spread the word** – Star the repo, share with others

## Version Policy

shipyard follows semantic versioning:

- **Patch versions** (0.x.Y) – Bug fixes, no breaking changes
- **Minor versions** (0.X.0) – New features, potentially breaking in 0.x
- **Major versions** (X.0.0) – Breaking changes (when we reach 1.0)

You won't be surprised by breaking changes. Update when you're ready, check the changelog, and migrate at your own pace.

## The Bottom Line

shipyard is production-ready today. It's maintained by someone who uses it in production. It may not have Meta's resources, but it's actively developed and improving.

If you need the safety of corporate backing, choose Docusaurus. If you want lean, composable building blocks and are comfortable with an independent project, shipyard is ready for you.
