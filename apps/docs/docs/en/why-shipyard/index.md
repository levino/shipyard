# Why shipyard?

With established tools like [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) already available, why create another page builder?

## Quick Answer

shipyard exists because:

- **Docusaurus** is powerful but heavy (SPA, React-only) and hard to extend with custom content types
- **Starlight** is lean but couples docs functionality too tightly—you can't use just the styling and navigation
- **shipyard** gives you composable building blocks on Astro, with easy migration in and out

## When to Use shipyard

shipyard is ideal when you want:

- A content-focused site on Astro without starting from scratch
- The flexibility to add custom content types beyond docs and blogs
- Clean separation between docs, blog, and other site sections
- A lean, static site without JavaScript bloat
- A well-documented component library (DaisyUI) you can extend
- Low-risk adoption—migrate in minutes, migrate out just as easily

## When to Use Something Else

- **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)** – If you need versioned docs, an extensive plugin ecosystem, and don't need custom content types. Good choice if long-term corporate backing matters to you.
- **[Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/)** – If you only need documentation and want tight Astro integration with minimal configuration.
- **[Plain Astro](https://astro.build/)** – If you want complete control and don't mind building everything from scratch.

## About the Name

Astro leans into the space theme—users are "astronauts," projects are "spaceships" ready to "launch." We're playing along.

A **shipyard** is where you build ships. Not just one ship, but many. It's a station—a mothership, if you will—designed to efficiently produce vessels that go out on their own missions.

That's the idea behind this project. shipyard is for people who frequently need to spin up new websites. Instead of starting from scratch each time, you have a well-equipped station where you can quickly assemble your next ship and send it off into the cosmos.

Build a site. Launch it. Build another. That's the shipyard workflow.

*By the way: it's always "shipyard" in lowercase, even at the start of a sentence.*

*shipyard exists because content sites shouldn't require complex frameworks or compromise on flexibility.*
