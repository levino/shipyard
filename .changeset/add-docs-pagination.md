You can now navigate between documentation pages using automatic next/previous pagination buttons. The pagination follows your sidebar structure and can be customized using `pagination_next` and `pagination_prev` frontmatter fields.

Blog posts now automatically show older/newer post navigation buttons, making it easy for readers to navigate chronologically through your blog content.

Both pagination components use Docusaurus-style grid layout that stays horizontal on all screen sizes, including mobile devices.
