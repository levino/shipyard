Add support for multiple documentation instances

You can now host multiple independent documentation sections within a single Astro site. This is useful for separating user guides, API references, tutorials, or any other content that needs its own navigation and URL structure.

Each documentation instance can be mounted at a custom path (e.g., `/guides/`, `/api-docs/`) and maintains its own sidebar navigation. See the multi-docs documentation for setup instructions.
