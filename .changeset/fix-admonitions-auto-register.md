"@levino/shipyard-base": patch

Admonitions and other markdown features now work out-of-the-box without manual configuration. The shipyard integration automatically registers the required remark plugins (remarkDirective, remarkAdmonitions, remarkNpm2Yarn), so you no longer need to add them to your Astro config.
